####About Us

##Why and What we do?

We are trying to simplify the college application process for undergraduates and post graduates.

At CIALFO, in past 3 years we have helped over **300+ students** to get into **top 50 colleges in the world** (some got into their dream college as well). But for the students, this comes at a price. Currently we charge between $8,000-$10,000 for our services and so not everyone can afford a personal mentor to help them get into their dream college. 

We want to level the field and make the application process simple and accessible to everyone in the world. 

The answer to that is - Technology.

We are building automated tools that will replace the mentor entirely (or partially) from the equation allowing students to do the entire process on their own. Along with helping students we are also helping companies and individual mentors like us by powering their operations with our technology. We are converting out platform into a SaaS solution. This will allow us to help more students in a faster way.

We are doubling our tech team in Bangalore to help build faster. We have raised a [seed fund of $800K](http://e27.co/singapore-based-edutech-startup-cialfo-raises-us800k-in-seed-funding-20141030/) last year and we want to use that to build our technology team. You can read more about us in the [Venture Beat Article](http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/14/cialfo-is-dominating-online-college-admissions-in-singapore-with-just-800k/)

##How we do?   

So far we have built two tools

1. [Get A Plan for SAT](http://getaplan.sitforsat.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=how_we_do&utm_campaign=hiring) - every student who wants to study in the US needs to take [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT). Most of the Asian students have difficulty in preparing for the vocabulary section. So we build Get A Plan (GAP) to make the learning process simple and easy. We build 4 fun word games which you can play and that will help you in memorising the words in a better way. See the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) coverage [here](http://www.wsj.com/video/can-vocabulary-apps-boost-sat-scores/A979447B-4C98-4459-A3D6-A5AAA8512748.html)

2. [CIALFO Application Mentoring - Companion](https://cialfo.co/companion?utm_source=github&utm_medium=how_we_do&utm_campaign=hiring) - We are building this tool to make the entire application process efficient and ultimately taking the mentor out of the picture. We are currently in beta ([companion.cialfo.co](https://companion.cialfo.co?utm_source=github&utm_medium=how_we_do&utm_campaign=hiring)) and testing the tool with students that are currently customers of Cialfo in Singapore and our partners in China.

Our tech stack: **Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, MySQL, NodeJS, AngularJS, jQuery, CSS3 (SCSS), HTML5**

Hosting (Cloud): **AWS, GCE (Google Compute Engine)**
