##Why and What we do?

We are trying to simplify the college application process for undergraduates and post graduates.

At CIALFO, in past 3 years we have helped over **300+ students** to get into **top 50 colleges in the world** (some got into their dream college as well). But for the students, this comes at a price. Currently we charge between $8,000-$10,000 for our services and so not everyone can afford a personal mentor to help them get into their dream college. 

We want to level the field and make the application process simple and accessible to everyone in the world. 

The answer to that is - Technology.

We are building automated tools that will replace the mentor entirely (or partially) from the equation allowing students to do the entire process on their own. To achieve this we need a huge team of engineers. We have raised a [seed fund of $800K](http://e27.co/singapore-based-edutech-startup-cialfo-raises-us800k-in-seed-funding-20141030/) last year and we want to use that to build a team of engineers.

##How we do?   

So far we have built two tools

1. [Get A Plan for SAT](http://getaplan.sitforsat.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=how_we_do&utm_campaign=hiring) - every student who wants to study in the US needs to take [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT). Most of the Asian students have difficulty in preparing for the vocabulary section. So we build Get A Plan (GAP) to make the learning process simple and easy. We build 4 fun word games which you can play and that will help you in memorising the words in a better way. See the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) coverage [here](http://www.wsj.com/video/can-vocabulary-apps-boost-sat-scores/A979447B-4C98-4459-A3D6-A5AAA8512748.html)

2. [CIALFO Application Mentoring](http://cialfo.co?force=true&utm_source=github&utm_medium=how_we_do&utm_campaign=hiring) - We are building this tool to make the entire application process efficient and ultimately taking the mentor out of the picture. We are currently in private beta ([app.cialfo.co](http://app.cialfo.co?utm_source=github&utm_medium=how_we_do&utm_campaign=hiring)) and only testing the tool with students that are currently customers of CIALFO in Singapore.

Our tech stack: **Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, MySQL, NodeJS, AngularJS, jQuery, CSS3 (SCSS), HTML5**

Hosting (Cloud): **AWS, GCE (Google Compute Engine)**
